Hello everyone!

I am AYUSH RAJ , a second year electronics engineering undergrad at Birla Institute of Technology,Mesra.I am deeply interested in AI and Blockchain technologies, looking forward to contribute in     these field.I am currently working on a open source project(which you can have a look [HERE](https://github.com/llucifer97/Pose-analysis-of-art)) which focuses on the pose analysis and gesture recognition in the works of Art.A lot of art historian are interested in the characters poses in artworks. But they have difficulties in working with big dataset of paintings and searching for specific poses among this dataset. Finding and analyzing similarities of poses in different paintings belonging to this dataset can be very painful due to the big size of the dataset. This project focuses on building machine learning models which could not only predict type of body gesture but also the emotion attached with the artwork. Along with it, scene intepretation will also be focsed under this project. I will be working under the mentorship of  [Peter Bell](https://uni-erlangen.academia.edu/PeterBell) and [Leonardo Impett](http://www.biblhertz.it/en/institute/staff/staffdatabase/staff-details/ma-leonardo-impett/) in upcoming three months. 
Enough said,I will be sharing my adventurous ride of next three months vis my blogs, which will be updated every weekend. I will discuss the challenges faced by me during the project and how I overcame them.
Fingers crossed! Wish me Luck!!
