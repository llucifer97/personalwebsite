        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am AYUSH RAJ , a second year electronics engineering undergrad at Birla Institute of Technology,Mesra.I am deeply interested in AI and Blockchain technologies, looking forward to contribute in     these field.I am currently working on a open source project(which you can have a look HERE) which focuses on the pose analysis and gesture recognition in the works of Art.A lot of art historian are interested in the characters poses in artworks. But they have difficulties in working with big dataset of paintings and searching for specific poses among this dataset. Finding and analyzing similarities of poses in different paintings belonging to this dataset can be very painful due to the big size of the dataset. This project focuses on building machine learning models which could not only predict type of body gesture but also the emotion attached with the artwork. Along with it, scene intepretation will also be focsed under this project. I will be working under the mentorship of  Peter Bell and Leonardo Impett in upcoming three months. \nEnough said,I will be sharing my adventurous ride of next three months vis my blogs, which will be updated every weekend. I will discuss the challenges faced by me during the project and how I overcame them.\nFingers crossed! Wish me Luck!!\n",
